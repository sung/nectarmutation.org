Please be advised that your registration can be pending if you are not a Brompton member 
until Nectar goes into an offical release in December 2012. 

Also, your membership can remain as a 'guest' which has a limited access for the information 
what Nectar provides. The Nectar website can be down without giving you any notice in advance.

The new terms and conditons could be added and applied in the futher.
It is assumed that you agreed what is written above if you make your account. 

The main purpose of this registration is to tell 
i) whether you're a robot (e.g. a web crawler) or human 
ii) whether you belong to Bromtpon or not.

Nectar does not store your password as it is - rather, it is encryped as a passphrase using SHA-1 
cryptographic algorithm and encoded with RFC 2307 (a salted digest). 
Hence your password is not readable and understandable to humans. 

Also be aware that password restoration is not implemented yet, so remember well 
otherwise there's no rescue.
