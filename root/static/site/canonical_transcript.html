Canonical transcripts are defined by a number of rules which for most species boils 
down to the longest transcript wins. However some species, like human, have a more 
complicated assignment method:

- if a gene has protein producing transcripts & divide into groups
		- Group A: protein_coding biotype transcripts in CCDS
		- Group B: take protein_coding biotype transcripts in havana
		- Group C: take protein producing biotypes in havana
		- Group D: remaining protein producing biotypes

Order these sets by length & then ask in order for a transcript i.e. if group A had 
no transcripts but group B had 2 transcripts then we would use the longest from B. 
Equality to CCDS is based on an identical exon coding model.

- if a gene has no protein producing transcripts
		- Group A: take transcripts in havana
		- Group B: all other transcripts

Apply the same rules but using just groups A & B.

Just adding more information to how a canonical transcript for a gene has chosen:

We take the longest CCDS model in each gene, if none available then the longest coding Ensembl-Havana 
merged transcript is chosen. If no merged transcript is present, we take the longest coding transcript 
regardless of their source; this can be either an Ensembl or a Havana transcript. 
Finally, if there are no coding transcripts in the gene, the longest non-coding transcript is selected.
